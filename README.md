### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Mads.

Iâ€™m a passionated .NET/C# developer, who likes to play around with C# and see how much I can do with it.

At daytimes I work for clients in C# .NET, ASP.NET MVC, Web API, Azure, Azure DevOps and technologies related to that.
At night times I play around more exotic technologies like Unity3d, Xamarin (iOS & Android) and other interesting stuff.

My main spare time project the last 1-2 years is a game called "Fireworks Mania".
